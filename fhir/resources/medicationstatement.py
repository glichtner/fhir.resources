    """Disclaimer: Any field name ends with ``__ext`` doesn't part of
    Resource StructureDefinition, instead used to enable Extensibility feature
    for FHIR Primitive Data Types.

    Record of medication being taken by a patient.
    A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A
    MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the
    medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking
    the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the
    patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a
    clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during
    the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication
    information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a
    prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician
    or other party maintains.
    
    The primary difference between a medicationstatement and a
    medicationadministration is that the medication administration has complete
    administration information and is based on actual administration
    information from the person who administered the medication.  A
    medicationstatement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no
    required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only
    know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication,
    where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product
    may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the
    Medication Statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a
    prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or
    other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not
    missing detailed information.
